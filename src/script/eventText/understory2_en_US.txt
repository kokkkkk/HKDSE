Classmate: Hey! What do you want to do in the future?
Me: Ummmm...
Classmate: I must be the ibanker, lawyer or doctor.
Me: I...
Classmate: Only these occupations can make me rich.
Other occupations are just a joke.
My mum must kill me if I am not entering those industries.
Who care those social loser?
If you are not rich, you must be the shame of the whole family.
